Adwaita gtk theme full black theme

fixed some personal visual issues with-

https://gitlab.com/tearch-linux/artworks/themes-and-icons/adwaita-dark-amoled

Download the Zip, extract, and Move the folder to /usr/share/themes/ (this ensures that the theme will be set system wide ~/.themes will not work with applications that require sudo privileges.)
